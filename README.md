# Demo treatment allocation

This is a very simplified demo that I made to have some data for an article I wrote. The goal is to:

* Compare prediction models with uplift models
* Optimize allocation of treatments
* Build a gui with some levers

I do this by imagining a scenario. Your company has three products with the innovative names of A, B and C. Each customer can have one, two or three products. Your goal is to increase the value (profits) of the existing customers. One approach to solve this problem is to increase the convergence, in other words, increase the number of products that the customers have. You have created a couple of different offers and now we are ready for the big question. Which customer should you communicate these offers with?

It is not:

* A complete guide on how to build, evaluate and run uplift models in a real world scenario

The focus of the demo would have been shifted completely if the goal was to incorporate all of my lessons learned from uplift models. If you are interested in that, then connect with me on linkedin www.linkedin.com/in/olalindeberg. I have left some questions in the comments as well. Feel free to think about them :)
